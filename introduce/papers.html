                                                We present DiffusionBERT, a new generative masked language model based
                                                on discrete diffusion models. Diffusion models and many pre-trained
                                                language models have a shared training objective, i.e., denoising,
                                                making it possible to combine the two powerful models and enjoy the best
                                                of both worlds. On the one hand, diffusion models offer a promising
                                                training strategy that helps improve the generation quality. On the
                                                other hand, pre-trained denoising language models (e.g., BERT) can be
                                                used as a good initialization that accelerates convergence. We explore
                                                training BERT to learn the reverse process of a discrete diffusion
                                                process with an absorbing state and elucidate several designs to improve
                                                it. First, we propose a new noise schedule for the forward diffusion
                                                process that controls the degree of noise added at each step based on
                                                the information of each token. Second, we investigate several designs of
                                                incorporating the time step into BERT. Experiments on unconditional text
                                                generation demonstrate that DiffusionBERT achieves significant
                                                improvement over existing diffusion models for text (e.g., D3PM and
                                                Diffusion-LM) and previous generative masked language models in terms of
                                                perplexity and BLEU score.

                                                Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient approach to adapting pre-trained
                                                language models to downstream tasks. Although prompt tuning has been
                                                shown to match the performance of full model tuning when training data
                                                is sufficient, it tends to struggle in few-shot learning settings. In
                                                this paper, we present Multi-task Pre-trained Modular Prompt (MP2) to
                                                boost prompt tuning for few-shot learning. MP2 is a set of combinable
                                                prompts pre-trained on 38 Chinese tasks. On downstream tasks, the
                                                pre-trained prompts are selectively activated and combined, leading to
                                                strong compositional generalization to unseen tasks. To bridge the gap
                                                between pre-training and fine-tuning, we formulate upstream and
                                                downstream tasks into a unified machine reading comprehension task.
                                                Extensive experiments under two learning paradigms, i.e., gradient
                                                descent and black-box tuning, show that MP2 significantly outperforms
                                                prompt tuning, full model tuning, and prior prompt pre-training methods
                                                in few-shot settings. In addition, we demonstrate that MP2 can achieve
                                                surprisingly fast and strong adaptation to downstream tasks by merely
                                                learning 8 parameters to combine the pre-trained modular prompts.

                                                Knowledge distillation (KD) has gained much attention due to its
                                                effectiveness in compressing large-scale pre-trained models. In typical
                                                KD methods, the small student model is trained to match the soft targets
                                                generated by the big teacher model. However, the interaction between
                                                student and teacher is one-way. The teacher is usually fixed once
                                                trained, resulting in static soft targets to be distilled. This one-way
                                                interaction leads to the teacher's inability to perceive the
                                                characteristics of the student and its training progress. To address
                                                this issue, we propose Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which
                                                also allows the teacher to learn to teach from the feedback of the
                                                student. In particular, IKD trains the teacher model to generate
                                                specific soft target at each training step for a certain student. Joint
                                                optimization for both teacher and student is achieved by two iterative
                                                steps: a course step to optimize student with the soft target of
                                                teacher, and an exam step to optimize teacher with the feedback of
                                                student. IKD is a general framework that is orthogonal to most existing
                                                knowledge distillation methods. Experimental results show that IKD
                                                outperforms traditional KD methods on various NLP tasks.

                                                models, early exiting has gained much attention in the NLP community. It
                                                allows samples to exit early at internal classifiers without passing
                                                through the entire model. Most existing work usually trains the internal
                                                classifiers independently and employs an exiting strategy to decide
                                                whether or not to exit based on the confidence of the current internal
                                                classifier. However, none of these works takes full advantage of the
                                                fact that the internal classifiers are trained to solve the same task
                                                therefore can be used to construct an ensemble. In this paper, we show
                                                that a novel objective function for the training of the ensemble
                                                internal classifiers can be naturally induced from the perspective of
                                                ensemble learning and information theory. The proposed training
                                                objective consists of two terms: one for accuracy and the other for the
                                                diversity of the internal classifiers. In contrast, the objective used
                                                in prior work is exactly the accuracy term of our training objective
                                                therefore only optimizes the accuracy but not diversity. Further, we
                                                propose a simple voting-based strategy that considers predictions of all
                                                the past internal classifiers to infer the correct label and decide
                                                whether to exit. Experimental results on various NLP tasks show that our
                                                proposed objective function and voting-based strategy can achieve better
                                                accuracy-speed trade-offs.

                                                Most downstream adaptation methods tune all or part of the parameters of
                                                pre-trained models (PTMs) through gradient descent, where the tuning
                                                cost increases linearly with the growth of the model size.
                                                By contrast, gradient-free methods only require the forward computation
                                                of the PTM to tune the prompt, retaining the benefits of efficient
                                                tuning and deployment.
                                                Though, past work on gradient-free tuning often introduces gradient
                                                descent to seek a good initialization of prompt and lacks versatility
                                                across tasks and PTMs.
                                                In this paper, we present BBTv2, an improved version of Black-Box
                                                Tuning, to drive PTMs for few-shot learning.
                                                We prepend continuous prompts to every layer of the PTM and propose a
                                                divide-and-conquer gradient-free algorithm to optimize the prompts at
                                                different layers alternately.
                                                Extensive experiments across various tasks and PTMs show that BBTv2 can
                                                achieve comparable performance to full model tuning and state-of-the-art
                                                parameter-efficient methods (e.g., Adapter, LoRA, BitFit, etc.) under
                                                few-shot settings while maintaining much fewer tunable parameters.

                                                Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial to the development of
                                                generative systems.
                                                In recent years, pre-trained language model (PLM) based metrics, such as
                                                BERTScore, have been commonly adopted in
                                                various generation tasks.
                                                However, it has been demonstrated that PLMs encode a range of
                                                stereotypical societal biases, leading to a concern on the fairness of
                                                PLMs as metrics.
                                                To that end, this work presents the first systematic study on the social
                                                bias in PLM-based metrics.
                                                We demonstrate that popular PLM-based metrics exhibit significantly
                                                higher social bias than traditional metrics on 6 sensitive attributes,
                                                namely race, gender, religion, physical appearance, age, and
                                                socioeconomic status.
                                                In-depth analysis suggests that choosing paradigms (matching,
                                                regression, or generation) of the metric has a greater impact on
                                                fairness than choosing PLMs.
                                                In addition, we develop debiasing adapters that are injected into PLM
                                                layers, mitigating bias in PLM-based metrics while retaining high
                                                performance for evaluating text generation.

                                                Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient tuning (PETuning) method for
                                                utilizing pre-trained models (PTMs) that simply prepends a soft prompt
                                                to the input and only optimizes the prompt to adapt PTMs to downstream
                                                tasks. Although it is parameter- and deployment-efficient, its
                                                performance still lags behind other state-of-the-art PETuning methods.
                                                Besides, the training cost of prompt tuning is not significantly reduced
                                                due to the back-propagation through the entire model. Through empirical
                                                analyses, we shed some light on the lagging performance of prompt tuning
                                                and recognize a trade-off between the propagation distance from label
                                                signals to the inserted prompt and the influence of the prompt on model
                                                outputs. Further, we present Late Prompt Tuning (LPT) that inserts a
                                                late prompt into an intermediate layer of the PTM instead of the input
                                                layer or all layers. The late prompt is obtained by a neural prompt
                                                generator conditioned on the hidden states before the prompt insertion
                                                layer and therefore is instance-dependent. Through extensive
                                                experimental results across various tasks and PTMs, we show that LPT can
                                                achieve competitive performance to full model tuning and other PETuning
                                                methods under both full-data and few-shot scenarios while possessing
                                                faster training speed and lower memory cost.

                                                Extremely large pre-trained language models (PTMs) such as GPT-3 are
                                                usually released as a service. It allows users to design task-specific
                                                prompts to query the PTMs through some black-box APIs. In such a
                                                scenario, which we call Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), the
                                                gradients of PTMs are usually unavailable. Can we optimize the task
                                                prompts by only accessing the model inference APIs? This paper proposes
                                                the black-box tuning framework to optimize the continuous prompt
                                                prepended to the input text via derivative-free optimization. Instead of
                                                optimizing in the original high-dimensional prompt space, which is
                                                intractable for traditional derivative-free optimization, we perform
                                                optimization in a randomly generated subspace due to the low intrinsic
                                                dimensionality of large PTMs. The experimental results show that the
                                                black-box tuning with RoBERTa on a few labeled samples not only
                                                significantly outperforms manual prompt and GPT-3’s in-context learning,
                                                but also surpasses the gradient-based counterparts, i.e., prompt tuning
                                                and full model tuning.

                                                In the era of deep learning, modeling for most natural language
                                                processing (NLP) tasks has converged into several mainstream paradigms.
                                                For example, we usually adopt the sequence labeling paradigm to solve a
                                                bundle of tasks such as POS-tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and
                                                chunking, and adopt the classification paradigm to solve tasks like
                                                sentiment analysis. With the rapid progress of pre-trained language
                                                models, recent years have witnessed a rising trend of paradigm shift,
                                                which is solving one NLP task in a new paradigm by reformulating the
                                                task. The paradigm shift has achieved great success on many tasks and is
                                                becoming a promising way to improve model performance. Moreover, some of
                                                these paradigms have shown great potential to unify a large number of
                                                NLP tasks, making it possible to build a single model to handle diverse
                                                tasks. In this paper, we review such phenomenon of paradigm shifts in
                                                recent years, highlighting several paradigms that have the potential to
                                                solve different NLP tasks.

                                                Supersized pre-trained language models have pushed the accuracy of
                                                various natural language processing (NLP) tasks to a new
                                                state-of-the-art (SOTA). Rather than pursuing the reachless SOTA
                                                accuracy, more and more researchers start paying attention to model
                                                efficiency and usability. Different from accuracy, the metric for
                                                efficiency varies across different studies, making them hard to be
                                                fairly compared. To that end, this work presents ELUE (Efficient
                                                Language Understanding Evaluation), a standard evaluation, and a public
                                                leaderboard for efficient NLP models. ELUE is dedicated to depicting the
                                                Pareto Frontier for various language understanding tasks, such that it
                                                can tell whether and how much a method achieves Pareto improvement.
                                                Along with the benchmark, we also release a strong baseline,
                                                ElasticBERT, which allows BERT to exit at any layer in both static and
                                                dynamic ways. We demonstrate the ElasticBERT, despite its simplicity,
                                                outperforms or performs on par with SOTA compressed and early exiting
                                                models. With ElasticBERT, the proposed ELUE has a strong Pareto Frontier
                                                and makes a better evaluation for efficient NLP models.

                                                Early exiting allows instances to exit at different layers according to
                                                the estimation of difficulty.Previous works usually adopt heuristic
                                                metrics such as the entropy of internal outputs to measure instance
                                                difficulty, which suffers from generalization and threshold-tuning. In
                                                contrast, learning to exit, or learning to predict instance difficulty
                                                is a more appealing way. Though some effort has been devoted to
                                                employing such “learn-to-exit” modules, it is still unknown whether and
                                                how well the instance difficulty can be learned. As a response, we first
                                                conduct experiments on the learnability of instance difficulty, which
                                                demonstrates that modern neural models perform poorly on predicting
                                                instance difficulty. Based on this observation, we propose a
                                                simple-yet-effective Hash-based Early Exiting approach HashEE) that
                                                replaces the learn-to-exit modules with hash functions to assign each
                                                token to a fixed exiting layer. Different from previous methods, HashEE
                                                requires no internal classifiers nor extra parameters, and therefore is
                                                more efficient.HashEE can be used in various tasks (including language
                                                understanding and generation) and model architectures such as seq2seq
                                                models. Experimental results on classification, regression, and
                                                generation tasks demonstrate that HashEE can achieve higher performance
                                                with fewer FLOPs and inference time compared with previous
                                                state-of-the-art early exiting methods.

                                                Both performance and efficiency are crucial factors for sequence
                                                labeling tasks in many real-world scenarios. Although the pre-trained
                                                models (PTMs) have significantly improved the performance of various
                                                sequence labeling tasks, their computational cost is expensive. To
                                                alleviate this problem, we extend the recent successful early-exit
                                                mechanism to accelerate the inference of PTMs for sequence labeling
                                                tasks. However, existing early-exit mechanisms are specifically designed
                                                for sequence-level tasks, rather than sequence labeling. In this paper,
                                                we first propose a simple extension of sentence-level early-exit for
                                                sequence labeling tasks. To further reduce the computational cost, we
                                                also propose a token-level early-exit mechanism that allows partial
                                                tokens to exit early at different layers. Considering the local
                                                dependency inherent in sequence labeling, we employed a window-based
                                                criterion to decide for a token whether or not to exit. The token-level
                                                early-exit brings the gap between training and inference, so we
                                                introduce an extra self-sampling fine-tuning stage to alleviate it. The
                                                extensive experiments on three popular sequence labeling tasks show that
                                                our approach can save up to 66%∼75% inference cost with minimal
                                                performance degradation. Compared with competitive compressed models
                                                such as DistilBERT, our approach can achieve better performance under
                                                the same speed-up ratios of 2×, 3×, and 4×.

                                                Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), aiming at predicting the
                                                polarities for aspects, is a fine-grained task in the field of sentiment
                                                analysis. Previous work showed syntactic information, e.g. dependency
                                                trees, can effectively improve the ABSA performance. Recently,
                                                pre-trained models (PTMs) also have shown their effectiveness on ABSA.
                                                Therefore, the question naturally arises whether PTMs contain sufficient
                                                syntactic information for ABSA so that we can obtain a good ABSA model
                                                only based on PTMs. In this paper, we firstly compare the induced trees
                                                from PTMs and the dependency parsing trees on several popular models for
                                                the ABSA task, showing that the induced tree from fine-tuned RoBERTa
                                                (FT-RoBERTa) outperforms the parser-provided tree. The further analysis
                                                experiments reveal that the FT-RoBERTa Induced Tree is more
                                                sentiment-word-oriented and could benefit the ABSA task. The experiments
                                                also show that the pure RoBERTa-based model can outperform or
                                                approximate to the previous SOTA performances on six datasets across
                                                four languages since it implicitly incorporates the task-oriented
                                                syntactic information.

                                                Recently, the emergence of pre-trained models (PTMs) has brought natural
                                                language processing (NLP) to a new era. In this survey, we provide a
                                                comprehensive review of PTMs for NLP. We first briefly introduce
                                                language representation learning and its research progress. Then we
                                                systematically categorize existing PTMs based on a taxonomy from four
                                                different perspectives. Next, we describe how to adapt the knowledge of
                                                PTMs to downstream tasks. Finally, we outline some potential directions
                                                of PTMs for future research. This survey is purposed to be a hands-on
                                                guide for understanding, using, and developing PTMs for various NLP
                                                tasks.

                                                With the emerging branch of incorporating factual knowledge into
                                                pre-trained language models such as BERT, most existing models consider
                                                shallow, static, and separately pre-trained entity embeddings, which
                                                limits the performance gains of these models. Few works explore the
                                                potential of deep contextualized knowledge representation when injecting
                                                knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Contextualized Language and
                                                Knowledge Embedding (CoLAKE), which jointly learns contextualized
                                                representation for both language and knowledge with the extended MLM
                                                objective. Instead of injecting only entity embeddings, CoLAKE extracts
                                                the knowledge context of an entity from large-scale knowledge bases. To
                                                handle the heterogeneity of knowledge context and language context, we
                                                integrate them in a unified data structure, word-knowledge graph (WK
                                                graph). CoLAKE is pre-trained on large-scale WK graphs with the modified
                                                Transformer encoder. We conduct experiments on knowledge-driven tasks,
                                                knowledge probing tasks, and language understanding tasks. Experimental
                                                results show that CoLAKE outperforms previous counterparts on most of
                                                the tasks. Besides, CoLAKE achieves surprisingly high performance on our
                                                synthetic task called word-knowledge graph completion, which shows the
                                                superiority of simultaneously contextualizing language and knowledge
                                                representation.

                                                Most existing deep multi-task learning models are based on parameter
                                                sharing, such as hard sharing, hierarchical sharing, and soft sharing.
                                                How choosing a suitable sharing mechanism depends on the relations among
                                                the tasks, which is not easy since it is difficult to understand the
                                                underlying shared factors among these tasks. In this paper, we propose a
                                                novel parameter sharing mechanism, named Sparse Sharing. Given multiple
                                                tasks, our approach automatically finds a sparse sharing structure. We
                                                start with an over-parameterized base network, from which each task
                                                extracts a subnetwork. The subnetworks of multiple tasks are partially
                                                overlapped and trained in parallel. We show that both hard sharing and
                                                hierarchical sharing can be formulated as particular instances of the
                                                sparse sharing framework. We conduct extensive experiments on three
                                                sequence labeling tasks. Compared with single-task models and three
                                                typical multi-task learning baselines, our proposed approach achieves
                                                consistent improvement while requiring fewer parameters.
